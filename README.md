Stats
--

Stats reports issues total count, pull-requests total count and reactive percent.
Reactive percent derives from `proactive` labeled issues and other issues count.
If no proactive labels, no reports.
By attaching `proactive` label to issues, it will be visible whether the work of
the team is healthy.

Idle Period
--

If there is a number of days in the Idle period, it will be automatically closed
if there are no issues or pulls that have not been updated over that number of days.
If you do not want to use this function, please set it to blank or 0.

Add Relations
--

Add relationship to notifications to Slack. Specifically, include assignees and reviewers.
If you use this option, you should set [code review assignments](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/managing-code-review-assignment-for-your-team) on Github.

Only P/R
--

Label Protection
